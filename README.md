# 3D Spinning Cube in C

This project demonstrates a straightforward implementation of a 3D spinning cube rendered directly in the console using the C programming language. It highlights fundamental concepts of 3D graphics programming, such as projection, rotation, and rendering. While the code itself is relatively simple, the underlying mathematics presented the real challenge!
